This is a computational model associated with the paper "Genetic Control of Organ Shape and Tissue Polarity" by
Amelia Green et al., published in PLoS Biol 8(11): e1000537, [10.1371/journal.pbio.1000537](doi.org://10.1371/journal.pbio.1000537)

The model is:

GPT\_Snapdragon\_2010\_Green\_et\_al
 
The model can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
